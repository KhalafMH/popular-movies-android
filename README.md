# popular-movies-android
The Popular Movies app project as required for my Udacity.com Android Developer Nanodegree.

To build the project follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a new directory under the root folder of the repository with the name ".secret".
3. Inside the ".secret" directory create a file named "api_keys".
4. Open the file with a text editor and type the following line but replace the placeholder with your own API Key from TheMovieDB.org:
```
theMovieDbApiKey = "<insert_your_api_key_here>"
```
5. Open the project in Android Studio and build and run.
